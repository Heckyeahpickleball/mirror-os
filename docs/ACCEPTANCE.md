- [ ] ASR: 60s clip → transcript with word timestamps; drift < 250ms; no crash
- [ ] Face v1: pose + blink reliably captured at ~10Hz
- [ ] Rules v0: “never/always” + head-shake cluster fire on canned test clips
- [ ] Debrief: 2+ timestamped questions rendered with skip/bookmark
- [ ] Nudge skeleton: ≤1 bubble/min; Bookmark writes an event
